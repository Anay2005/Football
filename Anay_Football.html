  Champions league is the soul of european footbal, its the biggest prize a club can ever get. I have no words to tell you about  the atmosphere during a match, its just awesome. Fans just go wild for their team, they just can't stop cheering. And that moment when a match-winning goal is scored at the last kick of the game. 'Its very hard to describe this'.

These legends are never to forget, they have just made RM the greatest club ever. There are some great records which is yet to be broken and are truly fantastic.
